This package is mostly used to validate custom implementation
of a specific onnx operator or **kernel**. The first sections
describe how to build the package and to add a new implementation
depending the technology it relies on (CPU, openmp, CUDA, eigen, ...).
The last section is a sorted index of the examples.
